  ### To Compile and Run if you are NOT using CLion:

  If you're using a terminal:
  1. Open a terminal in this folder
  2. Run:
     g++ -std=c++20 -Iinclude src/*.cpp -o SeaPlusPlus
  3. Run it:
     ./SeaPlusPlus        (macOS/Linux)
     SeaPlusPlus.exe      (Windows)

  ### Or if youre using Visual Studio Code:
  1. Open this folder in VS Code
  2. Press Ctrl + Shift + B to compile (tasks.json is included)
  3. Press Ctrl + Shift + ` to run the executable

  ### These steps should NOT be required if using Clion as CLion should create a new CMake folder for this project.
  You will only need to click "reload cmake"

  No additional configuration or setup should be required. Please contact me if something goes wrong.
